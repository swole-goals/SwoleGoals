Seated One-arm Cable Pulley Rows%&@Strength%&@Middle Back%&@Cable%&@Intermediate%&@8.5%&@ 1. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. 2. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the single handle attachment with your left arm using a palms-down grip. 3. With your arm extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise. 4. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. 5. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again. 6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/297/Male/m/297_2.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/297/Male/m/297_1.jpg

Snatch%&@Olympic Weightlifting%&@Quadriceps%&@Barbell%&@Intermediate%&@9.3%&@ 1. Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot. 2. With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position. 3. Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs. 4. As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion. 5. Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible. 6. Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position. 7. Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/187/Male/m/187_4.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/187/Male/m/187_2.jpg

Box Squat%&@Powerlifting%&@Quadriceps%&@Barbell%&@Intermediate%&@9.3%&@ 1. The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired. 2. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. 3. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. 4. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/665/Male/m/665_2.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/665/Male/m/665_1.jpg

Step Mill%&@Cardio%&@Quadriceps%&@Machine%&@Intermediate%&@9.1%&@ 1. To begin, step onto the stepmill and select the desired option from the menu. You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Use caution so that you don’t trip as you climb the stairs. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don’t fall. 2. Stepmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside while offering a similar rate of calories burned. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/656/Male/m/656_1.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/656/Male/m/656_2.jpg

Rocking Standing Calf Raise%&@Strength%&@Calves%&@Barbell%&@Beginner%&@8.7%&@ 1. This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck). 2. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. 3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. 4. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. 5. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. 6. Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out. 7. Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in. 8. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/200/Male/m/200_3.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/200/Male/m/200_1.jpg

Clean and Press%&@Strength%&@Shoulders%&@Barbell%&@Intermediate%&@9.4%&@ 1. Assume a shoulder-width stance, with knees inside the arms. Now while keeping the back flat, bend at the knees and hips so that you can grab the bar with the arms fully extended and a pronated grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Point the elbows out to sides. The bar should be close to the shins. Position the shoulders over or slightly ahead of the bar. Establish a flat back posture. This will be your starting position. 2. Begin to pull the bar by extending the knees. Move your hips forward and raise the shoulders at the same rate while keeping the angle of the back constant; continue to lift the bar straight up while keeping it close to your body. 3. As the bar passes the knee, extend at the ankles, knees, and hips forcefully, similar to a jumping motion. As you do so, continue to guide the bar with your hands, shrugging your shoulders and using the momentum from your movement to pull the bar as high as possible. The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out. 4. At maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar. 5. As the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar. Rack the bar across the front of the shoulders while keeping the torso erect and flexing the hips and knees to absorb the weight of the bar. 6. Stand to full height, holding the bar in the clean position. 7. Without moving your feet, press the bar overhead as you exhale.

Clean and Jerk%&@Olympic Weightlifting%&@Shoulders%&@Barbell%&@Expert%&@9.3%&@ 1. With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. 2. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees. 3. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. 4. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery. 5. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. 6. The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible. 7. Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders. 8. At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/670/Male/m/670_1.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/670/Male/m/670_3.jpg

This will be your starting position. 2. While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs. 3. After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale. 4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/207/Male/m/207_1.jpg%&@https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/207/Male/m/207_2.jpg
